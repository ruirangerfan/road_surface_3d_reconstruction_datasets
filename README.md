# Road Surface 3D Reconstruction Datasets

The datasets were created by [Rui (Ranger) Fan](https://www.ruirangerfan.com/).

## Overview: 
The datasets are used for stereo vision-based road surface 3D reconstruction and pothole detection. Kindly refer to our paper: ["Road Surface 3D Reconstruction Based on Dense Subpixel Disparity Map Estimation"](https://www.ruirangerfan.com/pdf/tip2018_fan.pdf), published on IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, for more details.

## Datasets: 
In this repository, there are three datasets (`dataset 1`, `dataset 2`, and `dataset 3`). 

Datasets 1 and 2 mainly aim at road surface 3D recontruction, while dataset 3 is used to evaluate the road surface 3D reconstruction accuracy. 

Each dataset includes **uncalibrated left and right images** and **calibrated left and right images**. The calibrated images are used for disparity map estimation, while the uncalibrated images and calibration parameters are used to reconstruct the 3D road geometry.
